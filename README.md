This is a stock portfolio simulation. Basically, you can add stocks from dates
up to yesterday into a portfolio that you can then
save and then can later load this portfolio (or start a new one and rewrite over the old)
and perform various analyses on the stocks in it as well as buy/sell more.
The program can be used as follows:
1) start program, choose one of the options given... If planning on using an existing portfolio, loading needs
to be the first step.
2) buy/sell as many stocks as you want. If you try to sell more of a particular stock than you own, it 
will sell as many as possible and let you know that it can't sell more than that.
3) you can press V to view all of the stocks in your porfolio along with some brief stats
4) you can press A to analyze the data. The first chart that appears is a pie-chart of how your initial amount of money invested is distributed amoung your stocks, the next chart is a time series of the total $$$ value of your portfolio from the earliest date of purchase of your first stock to the present date.
5) you can save, as well

Please note that you will need pandas in order to run this.
